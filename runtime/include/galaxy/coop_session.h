// Online co-op's session (docs/COOP_PLAN.md, "Hosting"): the room as the game sees it, over a transport
// (galaxy/net/transport.h). Host opens it on a port; Join connects to address:port, asks the host to let this player
// in and gets the room (its settings, the host's save and who is playing); Leave game leaves it, or closes it for
// everyone when the host leaves. As in sm64coopdx, the host is player 0 and the others get the lowest free number.
//
// A session runs on a thread of its own (the network keeps going while the game loads or a menu is open). Everything
// here may be called from any thread; what happened (a player joined, the join refused, the room closed) waits in
// take_events() for the game's thread. Later features (snapshots, chat) send their own messages with send() and
// receive them with on_message().
//
// The join is checked as sm64coopdx's is: the same session protocol and game version, the same disc
// (galaxy/coop_mods.h) and the room's mods. A joiner playing other mods isn't let in yet: the host sends the room's
// list, the joiner downloads the ones it lacks from the host (before it is a player, so nobody sees it), and the
// session ends with ModsReady for Nebula to start again with those mods and join once more.

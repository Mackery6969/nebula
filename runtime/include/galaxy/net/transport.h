// Online co-op's transport (docs/COOP_PLAN.md, "Hosting"), shaped like sm64coopdx's CoopNet: a lobby the host
// creates and others join, every member known by a peer id, and callbacks for what happens (the lobby made or joined,
// members joining and leaving, messages, errors). As sm64coopdx picks a NetworkSystem (its direct sockets or
// CoopNet), Nebula picks a Transport: DirectTransport (direct UDP to address:port) now; a relay that joins by a code
// could be another later without the session above it changing.
//
// A transport carries messages between members on the three channels of galaxy/net/link.h, routes them (the host
// passes a member's messages on to the others, so only the host's port needs to be reachable) and admits members to
// the lobby: its password, its size and the transport's protocol. What the game checks at a join (its version, its
// mods, the disc) is the session's, above it.
//
// Not thread-safe: one thread calls everything, and the callbacks come from update().

// Online co-op's chat (docs/COOP_PLAN.md, "Chat"), as sm64coopdx's: a keyboard opens a line (T), types a message and
// sends it to everyone in the room with Enter (Escape drops it). Each line shows with its sender's name in their
// character's colour, and joins and leaves show there too. Controllers have no way to type, so their players read it:
// the newest lines show over play for a while and fade, and all of the last few show while a line is typed.
//
// A message is its text alone: who said it is the session's sender, so a player can't speak as another. Its text is
// printable ASCII (what the game's font draws), cut to kChatMessageLimit. Chat may be called from any thread; the
// session's thread adds the lines that come.

// Online co-op's player snapshots (docs/COOP_PLAN.md "Remote players"): what each player sends of its Mario 30 times a
// second, unreliably, and how the others draw it. A snapshot is the instance the player is in (the stage and the
// scenario), where it is and how it is turned, and the animation playing. RemotePlayers keeps the latest few of each
// other player and gives them back a little in the past, interpolated between two, so a lost or late datagram doesn't
// show as a jump.

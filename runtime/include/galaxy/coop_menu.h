// The online co-op main menu (docs/COOP_PLAN.md, "Main menu"): its pages, rows and choices, kept by the host for
// every platform. The game draws it with the settings menu's screen (NebulaSettingsMenu) and sends its input back;
// what the player chose (play, quit, the settings) waits until the game takes it.
//
// The main page: Host, Join, Options, Quit. Host opens the Host page: the save to play (left and right through the
// saves, then New save), Rename and Erase, the room's port and password, its settings (room(): the coop_* runtime
// settings), the mods it plays with (a page of their own) and Host, which plays. Join opens the Join page (the address
// and password, then Join, which connects; Cancel or B stops it). B or Back returns to the main page. While a join
// connects, the joining screen takes the Join page's place: what the join waits for, a loading bar and Cancel. The
// player's name and character are Options' (its PLAYER page): the menu plays with room()'s, which the host keeps up
// with them.
//
// Text rows (a name, a port, an address, a password) are edited in place (TextEdit): pressed, they take the keyboard's
// typing (type()) or, letter by letter, a controller's: up and down pick the letter at the cursor, left and right move
// it, Minus (Tab's reset) deletes, A keeps the text and B drops it.

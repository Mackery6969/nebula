// Online co-op's shared world (docs/COOP_PLAN.md "Shared world state"): the server decides it, the game reports what
// its own play did and applies what it is told, as sm64coopdx syncs its levels.
//
// The things it follows are placed from the stage's files: coins and purple coins (alone or in rail and circle
// groups), star bits (alone or in groups), 1-Up and Life mushrooms and Rainbow Stars, and the plain enemies. Each has
// a key from its placement (its zone, name, link id and place), the same in every player's game. A thing the local
// play kills (taken, defeated) is reported gone; a thing the server says is gone is removed (made dead, its dead
// switch turned on, without its drops or sounds) and kept dead if the game brings it back. A coin another player
// took counts here too, a purple coin toward the 100, as sm64coopdx's collect_coin does.
//
// The save: Power Stars and event flags the game gets, and event values it sets, are reported (GameDataHolder); the
// session's are applied as they come, and again after each scene starts, for whatever the game doesn't have.

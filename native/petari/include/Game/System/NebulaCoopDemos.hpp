// Online co-op's cutscenes and transitions (docs/COOP_PLAN.md "Cutscenes and transitions"), as sm64coopdx has them:
// each player's demos are its own and stop nobody else, and the save's progress reaches everyone without its
// cutscene. What moves a player along still does:
// - A star taken in an instance is told to the others there (sm64coopdx's collect_star): a Grand Star takes them
//   along to its get and return, as sm64coopdx's Bowser 3 Grand Star does; a Power Star shows for them as one already
//   had (as a finished mission's does), theirs in the save, and they play on or take it for its return.
// - A star the room gave this player, taken later by the player itself, has its first return: the story's demos
//   (Rosalina's talks, the domes, the first trip to the Observatory) play as they would have, not the short one for
//   a star already had.
